## Problem 1
This section implements finite difference method and centered difference method using double- and single- presicion. It tests on *tan(x)* at *x=1* for step size *h=10^(-k), k = 0,...,16*. It produces loglog plot of error vs. step size.

## Problem 2
This section uses double-presicion on *xk+1 = 111−(1130−3000/xk−1)/xk*. The plot shows the convergence of x-value. 

## Problem 3
This section solves *ax^2 + bx + c = 0* by standard/alternative quadratic formula. It enhances numerical stability by avoiding dividing by zero, overflow/underflow, and cancellation problems. 

## Problem 4
This sections tests *xk+1 = g(xk)* for *g(x) = x + (x − 1)^2*. The plot show the convergence of x value.
